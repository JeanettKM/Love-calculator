## Description

The Love Calculator is a fun and lighthearted web application that allows users to find out the likelihood of their crush liking them back. Users input their name and their crush's name, and the application generates a random percentage indicating the chance of mutual affection.

I created this for an assigment and is for fun and learning purposes only.
The Javascript and HTML is written by me. The CSS is based on a template from Praashoo7 (Prashant).

## How to Use

Open the web application in your preferred browser.
Enter your name in the "Your name" input field.
Enter your crush's name in the "Your crush" input field.
Click the "Calculate" button to see the calculated chance of mutual affection.
